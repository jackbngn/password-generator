## Description

In this week's challenge, I was given a starter code of a password generator. However it was not functional and need to add additional codes to meet the requirements. 

## Requirements

- When the generate password button was clicked, it will open up a prompts for password criteria.
- The prompt will ask you for the length of the password from 8-128 characters. If the criteria is not met, then it will alert a message to try again.
- The prompt will ask a set of criteria that will be included in the password such as, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or speical characters.
